# P&P Pets and Plants

# P&P is the website of a farm in the outskirts of Berlin, that keeps a variety of farm animals, sells plants and welcomes people in their coffee shop. The site is aimed for people interested in visiting the farm. Users are able to get an overview of what the location has to offer, how to contact it and where to find it. Users can also subscribe to the farm's newsletter.
